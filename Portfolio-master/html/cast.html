            <h4>UX/UI</h4>
            <p class="bio">Cloud Storage is a young market that offers many
              possibilities even with<br>the large brands in the space. Our client
              needed a brand strategy and clear vision<br>for a cloud storage application
              with a focus on the networking and collaboration.

            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p class="bio">Our client knows that the move to cloud storage<br>
              is right for them, but they do not have a clear vision<br>
              for their product. They have several unknown<br>
              variables such as mobile or web, branding or their<br>
              target audience. They do know that the app should<br>focus on
              collaborative features.

            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p class="bio">Collaboration was key. So from the features down to the<br>brand
              name and imagery groups were the main selling point.<br>Cast meaning a group of
              birds. Birdlike images flock through<br>the design and the Tangram theme showcases
              the idea that<br>users are pieces of a whole. We've included personal, shared<br>
              cloud storage as well as the ability to create projects that reside<br>on a shared
              storage space. Users can edit documents simultaneously.

            <p class="bio">As the designer I lead the development of a design that was in
              scope and met, then exceeded client expectations.
            </p>
            <p class="bio">Each stage of the design process lead me confidently to the
              final design. Every step<br>was cross examined with the client brief in order
              to stay on task. Through user testing I was able<br>to make slight changes in
              order to catch the nuances of user needs that could not be understood<br>through
              the client brief alone. And one round of testing and competitive analysis lead
              to major brand updates<br>that have led me to what I believe is a product that
              meets expectations while delighting users.

            <p class="bio">70% of users surveyed stated that they used cloud storage services
              mainly for professional use.<br>Target audience should include professionals. The highest priority tasks were revealed to be<br>creating content
              organizing content and sharing content. Dropbox, Drive, Github, Simple designs
              that lets<br>content lead the design. Key collaborative features that align with
              user and client needs.

            <p class="bio">With a direction for the end user and functionality in mind I began mapping a

          <h3>Branding</h3>
            <p>As stated earlier, the theme of the design is collaboration.
              The brand design takes from that core idea.

    	         Name: Cast = Group of birds <br>Tangram = Pieces of a whole.
            </p>

            <p>Initially I felt confident in my choices but after reviewing competitors,
              User Tests and my own bias; I found that this design was not cohesive.
              It lacked the unity that the brand was built upon. I decided to discus the
              direction of this design with my senior designer. After meeting we decided
              change the logo into an origami shape. This new logo was united while still
              being comprised of shapes in order to maintain the original theme. The colors
              were changed in order to calm the image. Blue was then added too create a
              contrastable background.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Though this assignment I faced many challenges.
            I overcame setbacks by learning and growing myself as a designer.
            I learned to discipline my bias as an artist, and to empathize on a
            deeper level. With this project complete I can take this experience
            into my next assignment where I will improve my turnaround time and
            devotion to empathetic design practices.
