          <p>Hey, I'm Phillip, an anime and film enthusiast,seeking a career that aligns <br>with my current interests and skills. At nineteen I moved out of my parent's<br> home and began
            to experience a new world, one I was fearful and curious about. <br>I began to craft the life I wanted to live. I had recently started a small film studio.<br> With that my love for
            film and anime led to an appreciation for Japanese design sense. <br>I then moved from Charlotte NC to Washington D.C with my siblings. Having a taste of independence made me anxious to get back to designing my own life.<br>While studying filmmakers and designers, I learned skills essential to the design profession.<br>

            <p>I gained experience defining project scope, negotiating and learning about users' goals.<br>As well as how to shape a useful product experience. I then decided that a career in design<br>
            could be what I needed. Effective design shapes the aesthetics, interactions and experiences of our world.<br>I will use design to explore philosophical questions of how and why we live
            the way we do.<br>With this I will convince people to reflect on an individual level. My experiences have trained<br>me to deliver content a skill that lies at the heart of design.
